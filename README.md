# Roam
Roam helps travelers make trip planning easier and more efficient. Rather than wading through guide books, ratings sites and maps, users can use the Roam travel app to surface their destination's top attractions, hotels, restaurants, museums and festivals in one click. Search results provide details, map locations and a snippet and link to further Yelp reviews for each recommendation.

Users can create folders for each trip where they can save their favorite places and view them all together on a single map. Roam saves time for travelers who want to discover the best a city has to offer without hours of research, and easily navigate to their top picks on the go.

#### In the works:


###### Shared Folders
I would like for users to be able to invite friends to view and collaborate on shared folders. This will allow multiple people to plan trips together using Roam.

###### Facebook Travel Plan Sharing
I would like to incorporate the Facebook API, allowing users to login/signup through Facebook, and enabling friends to access shared travel plans.

###### Google
In a future version, I'd like to integrate the Google Calendars API such that users can export the events from their itinerary directly to a Google Calendar, or import events from a Google Calendar to their itinerary.
